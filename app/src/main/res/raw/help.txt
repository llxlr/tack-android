#### Why is the metronome service notification displayed when I leave the app?

If you haven't enabled "Permanent notification" in settings, the notification is necessary for the metronome service to stay alive when the app is in background.
The service manages playback and keeps track of real-time data like timer or elapsed time to separate playback from the app interface.
You can move the service to the background by tapping "Stop", but this no longer guarantees that it isn't killed by the system. This may result in resets of timer and elapsed time until the service is in foreground again.
If you don't need the timer progress or elapsed time anymore, you can either tap on stop in the notification or close the app from recent apps for the notification to disappear.
You can also enable permanent notification in settings to always have access to start/stop in the notifications area.

#### Why disappears the metronome service notification when I close the app?

When you close the app from recent apps, the metronome service is stopped and the notification disappears. This is intended behavior to save battery and resources.
If you want to permanently keep the notification for start/stop access, you can enable "Permanent notification" in settings and don't dismiss the app from recent apps.

#### How can I change the tempo?

To change the tempo, you can rotate the circle in the center or tap on the buttons on the left and the right of the circle.
By long-pressing the buttons, you can change the tempo even faster.

#### How do I set the time signature?

Simply look at the first number of your time signature and set the beats in Tack accordingly. That means 4 beats for 4/4, 2 for 2/2 and so on. 6/8 is a bit special, here you need 2 beats with optionally 3 subdivisions because only the 1st and the 4th eights are downbeats.
Additionally you can change the emphasis of beats by tapping on them. In options you also can select a swing percentage, which automatically sets the subdivisions for you.

#### How do I disable swing?

If you have enabled swing in the options, all Tack does is to set the subdivisions for you. To disable swing, simply set the subdivisions manually to your liking.
Instead of that, you can also disable subdivisions completely in settings.

#### How can I get Tack for my language?
