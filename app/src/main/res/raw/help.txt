##### How can I change the tempo?

To change the tempo, you can drag and rotate the tempo picker in the center or tap on the buttons on the left and the right of the circle.
By tapping the tempo picker, you can open the tempo dialog to set the tempo by tapping in BPM or using keyboard input.

##### How do I set the time signature?

Simply look at the first number of your time signature and set the beats in Tack accordingly. That means 4 beats for 4/4, 2 for 2/2 and so on. 6/8 is a bit special, here you use 2 beats with optionally 3 subdivisions because only the 1st and the 4th eights are downbeats.
Additionally you can change the emphasis of beats by tapping on them. In options you also can select a swing percentage, which automatically sets the subdivisions for you.

##### How do I disable swing?

If you have enabled swing in the options, all Tack does is to set the subdivisions for you. To disable swing, simply set the subdivisions manually to your liking.

##### How does the song library work?

The song library is a collection of metronome configurations that you can save and apply. To save your current configuration, simply open the song library and create a new song. The current configuration will be added to the parts list. After you gave the song a name, don't forget to save your result with a tap on the disk icon in the top right corner.
Your created songs are displayed in the song picker on the main page, but you can open a full-screen list if you want. To change the order of the songs, choose your desired order from the menu in the top right corner. The same order is applied to the home screen widget.

##### How does the song picker work?

All songs from your song library are displayed in the song picker on the main page, but you can open a full-screen list if you want. The order depends on your choice in the menu. To apply a song, simply tap on it. You can also jump to a specific part of a song by tapping on the current part below the song open the parts dialog or by using the skip buttons.
If you want to switch back to the configuration you had before selecting a song, tap the Ã— next to the song name.

##### Why does the song not switch to the next part?

To switch to the next part of a song automatically, each part needs to have a duration set. If you don't set a duration, the part is considered to be infinite.
To set a duration, simply tap on the current song to open song details and set the part's duration by tapping on the edit icon of the part. Don't forget to save your changes!

##### Why is the metronome service notification displayed when I leave the app?

If you haven't enabled "Permanent notification" in settings, the notification is necessary for the metronome service to stay alive when the app is in background.
The service manages playback and keeps track of real-time data like timer or elapsed time to separate playback from the app interface.
You can move the service to the background by tapping "Stop", but this no longer guarantees that it isn't killed by the system. This may result in resets of timer and elapsed time until the service is in foreground again.
If you don't need the timer progress or elapsed time anymore, you can either tap on stop in the notification or close the app from recent apps for the notification to disappear.
You can also enable permanent notification in settings to always have access to start/stop in the notifications area.

##### Why does the metronome service notification disappear when I close the app?

When you close the app from recent apps, the metronome service is stopped and the notification disappears. This is intended behavior to save battery and resources.
If you want to permanently keep the notification for start/stop access, you can enable "Permanent notification" in settings and don't dismiss the app from recent apps.
